excerpt: "Systematic PRISMA review that organizes evaluation metrics for local explanation techniques into complementary taxonomies."
---

We surveyed over six thousand XAI articles to catalogue how practitioners measure explanation fidelity, robustness, fairness, and usability. The study proposes two complementary taxonomies—one organized by application scenario, another by metric behavior—to help researchers choose evaluation protocols that match their deployment constraints.
