excerpt: "Live demo of a radiology reporting assistant where multi-agent RAG explanations stay aligned with concept bottleneck classifications."

This demo builds on our ECIR paper and showcases an interactive UI where clinicians can inspect CBM activations, ask questions to multi-agent RAG helpers, and export trustworthy radiology reports. It emphasizes human-AI collaboration features such as provenance tracking and hallucination mitigation.

The reference implementation and evaluation protocol are available via the [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20898) and the ACM Digital Library (DOI: 10.1145/3731406.3731970).
