excerpt: "Presents MedDeepCycleAL, a configurable active-learning loop with annotation tooling for ophthalmology image segmentation."
---

MedDeepCycleAL bundles model selection, query strategies, annotator UI, and deployment plumbing into a single modular toolchain so clinicians can iteratively curate OCT datasets. The technical report documents engineering decisions, provides configuration recipes, and illustrates how the framework plugged into Ophthalmo-AI.
