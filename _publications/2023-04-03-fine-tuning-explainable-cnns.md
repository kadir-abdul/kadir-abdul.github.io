excerpt: "Builds a Grad-CAM-aware training loop so dermatologists can fine-tune lesion classifiers using simultaneous class and explanation feedback."
---

The paper integrates Grad-CAM saliency constraints directly into a CNN fine-tuning pipeline. Dermatologist feedback is simulated on both the predicted class and the explanation map, leading to better alignment between highlighted regions and medically meaningful structures without sacrificing accuracy.
