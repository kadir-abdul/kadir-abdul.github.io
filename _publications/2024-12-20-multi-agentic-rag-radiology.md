We chain a CBM-based classifier with a team of specialized RAG agents: one maintains medical concept embeddings, others retrieve domain literature, and a writer agent drafts reports judged by LLM-as-a-judge metrics. The result balances diagnostic accuracy with transparent rationales for radiologists.
