excerpt: "Uses edge awareness and superpixel uncertainty to cut annotation cost for multi-class OCT segmentation down to a few percent."
---

EdgeAL leverages edge-derived priors when selecting which superpixels to annotate, dramatically reducing manual effort for optical coherence tomography (OCT) segmentation tasks while sustaining 99% Dice. The paper also releases code at [github.com/Mak-Ta-Reque/EdgeAL](https://github.com/Mak-Ta-Reque/EdgeAL).
