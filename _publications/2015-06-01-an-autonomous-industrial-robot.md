We engineered a tracked, sensor-rich manipulator that can localize pallets, pick up heavy loads, and autonomously place them in target bays, reducing the need for manual handling in hazardous spaces. The system fuses ultrasonic ranging with camera feedback and is driven by a programmable logic controller for repeatable motions under variable payloads.

The paper details the mechatronic design, safety interlocks, and real-world experiments that motivated a broader line of interactive robotics research. You can read the proceedings article via the [IEEE Xplore entry](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2015.7333984).
