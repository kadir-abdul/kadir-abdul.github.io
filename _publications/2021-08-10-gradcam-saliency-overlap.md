excerpt: "Quantifies how Grad-CAM saliency maps align with dermatologist-defined visual cues on ISIC dermoscopy images."

We compared Grad-CAM regions produced by CNNs for melanoma detection against explainable visual features dermatologists rely on (e.g., streaks, color variegation). The analysis highlights when saliency maps faithfully cover the same areas that human experts deem important and where gaps remain.

The CD-MAKE paper situates this evaluation protocol within broader XAI research for computer-aided dermatology. Access the official version through [SpringerLink](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84060-0_16).
