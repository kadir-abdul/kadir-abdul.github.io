# CGDL-Based Concept Region Selection with Reinforcement Learning

This document explains **from the basics** how to combine:

1. **Concept-Guided Dictionary Learning (CGDL)** – to discover concepts and form *positive/negative* sets of images.  
2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – to automatically find the most relevant **image regions** that support or refute a concept.

The goal is:  
> For a given concept (e.g., "red car"), automatically find **where** in the image the model is looking when it says "yes, the concept is present" or "no, it is absent".

## Key Objectives

- Understand concept discovery through CGDL
- Learn how RL can optimize region selection
- Discover interpretable regions in images for concept validation

## Research Areas

- Explainable AI (XAI)
- Concept-based explanations
- Region-based attention mechanisms
- Reinforcement learning for region selection
