## Hello, I'm Abdul Kadir

I'm a researcher at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) on the Saarland Informatics Campus in Saarbrücken, Germany, where I build transparent deep-learning systems for healthcare and human-AI collaboration. My work blends deep learning, explainable AI, and interactive machine learning so clinicians and domain experts can understand, challenge, and ultimately trust the models they rely on.

I spend most days inside DFKI's Interactive Machine Learning department, collaborating with Prof. Dr.-Ing. Daniel Sonntag and an interdisciplinary team of engineers, clinicians, and designers. My recent projects explore how to harmonize feature attributions across architectures and how scanpath analysis can unlock richer, gaze-driven interaction.

### What I focus on

- Transparent decision-support models for medical imaging and computer vision workflows.
- Human-in-the-loop pipelines that transform expert feedback into fast model updates.
- Multi-modal learning that fuses gaze data, images, and textual context for richer explanations.

### Selected highlights

- Best Paper Award at CD-MAKE 2021 for research on explainable AI in medical imaging.
- Lead author on studies advancing harmonized feature attribution and scanpath-driven interaction design.
- Driving collaborations within DFKI’s Interactive Machine Learning department since 2019.

### Currently exploring

- Generative and interactive interfaces that let clinicians query models conversationally.
- Evaluation frameworks that make XAI insights comparable across neural architectures.
- Lightweight toolkits that bring trustworthy AI practices into day-to-day lab work.

### Beyond research

I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Saarland University with a focus on machine learning, data science, and image processing, and I continue to mentor students stepping into this space. Outside the lab I enjoy exchanging ideas at research meetups, helping teams translate complex models into clear narratives, and supporting initiatives that keep responsible AI grounded in real-world impact.
